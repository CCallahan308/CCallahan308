## Hi, I'm Christian 👋

Business Intelligence Analyst at a critical access hospital, dual MBA / M.S. Data Science candidate, and **Python-first** builder of financial and clinical analytics systems. I like turning messy operational data into reliable decision engines that protect revenue, improve patient experience, and scale without a lot of manual effort.

## What I’m Working On

- Automating clinical and financial reporting for a rural health system using T-SQL, Tableau, and Python ELT pipelines.
- Building algorithmic trading and backtesting frameworks with walk-forward validation, realistic transaction costs, and solid risk controls.
- Developing web-based financial modeling tools that generate fully linked 3-statement models and interactive dashboards from live market data.

- Replaced a failed \$150k vendor reporting platform with in-house Tableau dashboards, saving \$10k annually and speeding up executive reporting.  
- Built SQL staging environments and T-SQL workflows to keep EMR migrations and insurance billing feeds accurate in a critical access hospital.
