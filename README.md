## Hi, I'm Christian 👋

Business Intelligence Analyst at a critical access hospital, dual MBA / M.S. Data Science candidate, and **Python-first** builder of financial and clinical analytics systems.[file:1][file:2] I focus on turning messy operational data into reliable decision engines that protect revenue, improve patient experience, and scale with minimal manual intervention.
